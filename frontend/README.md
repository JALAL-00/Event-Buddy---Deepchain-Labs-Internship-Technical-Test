## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend development environment set up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A running instance of the **[Event Buddy Backend](https://github.com/JALAL-00/Event-Buddy---Deepchain-Labs-Internship-Technical-Test/tree/main/backend)**. *This frontend will not function without it.*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JALAL-00/Event-Buddy---Deepchain-Labs-Internship-Technical-Test.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Event-Buddy---Deepchain-Labs-Internship-Technical-Test/frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the `frontend` directory.

    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

    Add the following line to the `.env.local` file. This tells the Next.js application where to send API requests.

    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see the application in action.
